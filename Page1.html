        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>
            Albania is a country located in Southeastern Europe on the Balkan Peninsula. It is bordered by Montenegro
            to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, North Macedonia to the east, and Greece to the south. To the
            west, Albania has a coastline along the Adriatic Sea, while to the southwest, it faces the Ionian Sea. The
            capital and largest city of Albania is Tirana.

        <h2>Language</h2>
        <p>The Albanian language is a unique Indo-European language with its own distinct branch within the language
            family. It has two main dialects: Gheg and Tosk. The Gheg dialect is spoken in the northern part of the
            country, while the Tosk dialect is spoken in the south. The two dialects are mutually intelligible,
            meaning speakers can generally understand each other despite some differences in pronunciation, vocabulary,
            and grammar. </p>
